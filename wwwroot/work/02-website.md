##This website

This website is another example of work that I have done.
The website is a single-page application created with [ReactJS](https://reactjs.org/) for the frontend
and [.NET Core](https://dotnet.github.io/) for the backend.

The project is [MIT licenced](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT), so feel free to use and modify the source for your own projects. 
Just remember to give credit if you copy directly.

For the source please have a look at the GitHub repository.
