##Character Builder

The goal of the project is to create a mostly automated character generation tool
for the [Pathfinder RPG](http://paizo.com/pathfinder/rpg) system.

The project is currently shelved because of poor performance, it will however be continued at some time
in the future, perhaps in the context of the release of [Pathfinder 2.0](http://paizo.com/pathfinderplaytest)
making it for the new system, with the smaller number of items to be implemented at the beginning.
