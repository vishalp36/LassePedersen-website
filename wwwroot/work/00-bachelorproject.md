##Bachelor project

###Abstract
This study in determining a representative day was founded in a fascination of smart
buildings and interest in modelling data from such smart buildings. One of the current
major issues on a global scale is high energy consumption and wasted energy. To 
combat these issues this project set out to experiment with using data modelling to find 
patterns in building data. The purpose of modelling the building data, is to use it to find
areas in which reducing energy consumption is a possibility. Additionally the models can
also be used to find irregularities in the energy consumption, that is to find places
where the data does not seem to match the expectation.

Most of the experimentation was done through trial and error, as it also served as a
method of learning more about statistical modelling and time series data.

The project resulted in several different models of varying complexity and accuracy,
capable of modelling the expected power consumption throughout any given day,
based on the data from a building. The results of the project could quite easily be
implemented in industries with interest in data modelling, as well as be used for
increasing energy efficiency, by using only the necessary energy for any given task, by
locating where energy is wasted.

The software was programmed using Python, but requires some C++ build tool to compile and run the graphical user interface.
