##Starting work at Netcompany A/S

As of August 1st 2018 I am starting as a software developer and consultant at Netcompany A/S.

Netcompany A/S is an IT services company delivering IT projects. Below is a section from [Netcompany's about page](https://www.netcompany.com/en-GB/About-us/We-are-Netcompany):

I am very excited to start this new chapter of my life and I truly view it as the real start of my carreer. I believe that the possibilities that Netcompany offer are very much in line with what I want to do, and Netcompany Academy is one of the most interesting and intriguing parts of my new work place. I hope to be able to use Netcompany Academy to better myself in many ways, my current desire is go heavily into security engineering, and I hope it will be an option.
