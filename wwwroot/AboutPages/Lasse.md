**Name**: Lasse Pedersen

**Age**: 23

I am currently studying Software Engineering on sixth semester.

In addition to this project for Internet Technologies I am writing my Bachelor's project.

My Bachelor's is regarding statistical data analysis with the help of machine learning algorithms.

After this semester I end my studies, at least for now, as I aim to start working in the software industry this summer.

For this website I have been in charge of the **markdown interpretation** and the **user handling with password salting and hashing**. For improvements increasing the number of times passwords are hashed will increase the security and using SSL, with an actual domain and server, will ensure the safe transfer of passwords.
